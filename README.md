<h1>Battleship</h1>
<br>
<p>Battleship is a Python terminal gamewhich runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.
The user and computer place their ship on the board and both have to eliminate the enemy ship before each of them.</p>
<br>
<p>Below you will find the live version of my project.</p>


<h2>How to play</h2>
<br>
<p>Battleship is based on the classic pen-and-paper game. In this version the player decides the size of the board.<br>
After that the player places one ship on the board. The computer does the same and chooses to place a ship in a random position.
The player ship location is marked by a # while the computer ship is hidden from the player. Player missed attacks are marked by an X and computer missed
attacks are marked by a *. When either sinks the enemy battleship a message occurs who hit and tells the player if the player won or lost.</p>
